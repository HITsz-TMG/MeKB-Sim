🚀 We are thrilled to introduce **MeKB-Sim**, a multi-agent simulation platform that closely mimic real-life interactions, based on a dynamic personal knowledge base, termed **MeKB**.

🤖 The MeKB of each agent consists of attributes crucial for modeling theory of mind, such as linguistic style, personality, and memory.
The dynamic nature of MeKB to enable agents to adapt their activities and interactions with other agents effectively. 



Our platform includes a Unity WebGL game interface
for visualization and an interactive monitoring panel that presents the agents’ planning,
actions, and MeKBs over time.
