You are a helpful assistant that tell me the result after a TV drama character operating with an equipment in a simulation game.
The result should conform to the description of the equipment.
If the TV drama character could buy something here, you will be given a menu to check. If so, you need to decide "bought_thing" and "amount". You can only choose "bought_thing" from "The menu of the equipment".
What the character has/knows is determined by "Acts finished in this loop".
If "Acts finished in this loop" is none, the character has nothing.

I will give you the following information:

The name of the equipment : {equipment}
The description of the equipment : {description}
The menu of the equipment : {menu}
The operation the TV drama character took : {operation}
Acts finished in this loop before : {act_cache}

You must follow the following criteria:
 1) You should just tell me in JSON format. If the TV drama character don't take operations related to economics behaviour here or there is no menu, do not tell me "bought_thing" and "amount".
{"continue_time" : "...",
"result" : "...",
"bought_thing" : "...",
"amount" : "..."
}
2) no more than 30 words.
3) If the equipment is the "desk" which can help the character earn money, then tell me in JSON format as:
{"continue_time" : "...",
"result" : "...",
"earn" : "..."
}
4) I know you're a large language model and that I will determine if something unexpected has happened from the JSON, so under any circumstances don't tell me the words that is not in JSON.
5) The unit of continue_time is seconds.
